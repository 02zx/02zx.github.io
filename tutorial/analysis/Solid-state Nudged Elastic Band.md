## generalized solid-state nudged elastic band (G-SSNEB) method 

 insensitive to the choice of periodic cell notably, the lowest-energy transition mechanism found by our G-SSNEB changes with cell size from a concerted transformation of the cell
 coordinates in small cells to a nucleation event in large cells
